          Paulo Coelho’s 1988 novel is a deceptively simple tale. On its
          surface, it is the story of Santiago, a shepherd who leaves his native
          Spanish countryside in search of treasure. Scratch a little deeper,
          though, and we find an allegory of self-discovery – of the journey we
          must all embark on if we are to uncover and fulfill our deepest
          desires.

        <p className="my-4">
          For Santiago, the catalyst for this journey is a dream – a recurring
          dream that he has had since childhood. It’s apt that a dream sets The
          Alchemist’s plot in motion. The novel plays with a host of recurring
          motifs including omens, fate, and alchemy, but the dream is perhaps
          the most important motif of all. In fact, the story both begins and
          ends with a dream.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">So, what was Santiago’s dream?</p>
        <p className="my-4">
          Let’s first set the scene; the details here will be important later
          on. Santiago has had a long day tending to his flock of sheep in the
          hills of the Spanish countryside. He searches for somewhere to shelter
          for the night and settles on an abandoned church. The church roof has
          crumbled away, and a sycamore tree has grown on the spot where the
          church sacristy once stood. Santiago falls asleep under the tree’s
          branches. As he sleeps, he dreams. In his dream, a child appears. She
          takes Santiago by the hand and transports him to the pyramids of
          Egypt, a place Santiago has never visited in waking life. At the
          pyramids, the child tells Santiago that if he visits the pyramids, he
          will find a treasure. But before she can tell him precisely where
          he’ll find this treasure, Santiago wakes up.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          Convinced the dream has a hidden meaning, he visits a fortune-teller
          and asks her to interpret it. She tells him the dream means he should
          travel to the pyramids, where he will find a treasure. Santiago is
          frustrated – this is a far simpler interpretation than he expected.
          But the fortune-teller reproves him. In life, she tells him, it’s the
          simplest things that are the most extraordinary, and only the wisest
          among us can understand them.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          Santiago does follow his dream. He sells his sheep and embarks on the
          journey to Egypt. But his dream is also intertwined with a long-held
          desire to travel. In fact, Santiago gave up a life of religious study
          to become a shepherd explicitly to pursue his desire for freedom and
          travel, much to his parents' disappointment. Throughout the book,
          dreams – whether directly or obliquely – often reflect the truest
          desires of the dreamer.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          But while dreams in The Alchemist often serve to articulate a desire,
          it’s a little more nuanced than that. Shortly before Santiago begins
          his journey, he meets a character called Melchizedek. Although he’s
          disguised as a shabby old man in eccentric clothes, Melchizedek is
          actually a magical king. Melchizedek introduces Santiago to an
          important concept – the “Soul of the World.” This is essentially the
          world’s spiritual framework, encompassing the soul of every living and
          nonliving being. But while this framework exists all around us, it is
          up to us to connect to it. One of the ways the Soul of the World
          communicates with us is through our dreams. So by listening to and
          acting on our dreams, we begin to tap into the spiritual power of the
          Soul of the World.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          Let’s return, for now, to that first dream. Santiago’s vision of
          buried treasure takes him from Spain to Africa, where he is robbed by
          thieves of everything he has. He builds up his fortune once again by
          working in a shop that sells crystals, travels through the desert with
          a camel caravan, is caught up in conflict between warring desert
          tribes, falls in love at a desert oasis, and meets a genuine
          alchemist. At every step, there are distractions both positive – like
          love or wealth – and negative – like conflict or hardship – that
          threaten to sway Santiago from the pursuit of his dream. But he is
          resolute in the face of these diversions and ultimately arrives at the
          pyramids. He sees a scarab beetle scuttling along the sand and takes
          it for an omen, so he begins to dig.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          As he shovels sand, two young men see him and are convinced he is
          burying treasure. They attack him, trying to steal this treasure.
          Eventually, Santiago explains to them that he is digging here because
          of what he saw in his dreams. The men release him, but they are
          scornful. He shouldn’t be so foolish as to believe in dreams, says
          one. After all, he himself has had a recurring dream all his life –
          but has never been so stupid as to devote his life to pursuing it.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          The young man’s dream? That if he were to ever visit Spain and find a
          crumbling church in the countryside, he should dig deep down where a
          sycamore tree grows; there, he will find untold treasure.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          In this sense, Santiago’s dream takes him full circle. On his return
          home, he does find the treasure. And the gypsy’s wisdom is proved
          correct – the location of the treasure couldn’t have been simpler for
          Santiago to find. Yet, to unearth it, he first had to experience an
          extraordinary journey.
