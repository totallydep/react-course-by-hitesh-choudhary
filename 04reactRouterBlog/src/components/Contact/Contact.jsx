        Email newsletters can include a weekly round-up of blog posts, case
        studies regarding your product or service, upcoming company events and
        webinars, or even a behind-the-scenes look at your company. Of course,
        you don't want to create a newsletter just to create one â€” instead, you
        should thoroughly research what your audience might prefer and what your
        company is well-suited to offer. You're in luck if you're looking for
        general email newsletter inspiration.
